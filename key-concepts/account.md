## Balances

Participants should be aware that balances attached to addresses can be held in different states, including:

* **`available`**: funds that are available for any transaction.
* **`bonded`**: funds currently locked for validating or nominating
* **`unbonding`**: funds that are being unbonded \(will be redeemable after the bonding period has passed\)
